# Skin Lesion Analysis using Raspberry Pi - 5


This is my current working project on Skin Lesion Analysis.

# Objective 
To Develop a lightweight AI model for real-time skin lesion analysis. 
To Enable on-device processing for fast diagnosis without high computational 
requirements. 
To Design a user-friendly system suitable for use by general practitioners, non-experts, 
and individuals. 
To Deliver an affordable and scalable solution to support early skin cancer detection in 
diverse healthcare settings and minimizing Misdiagnosis.
